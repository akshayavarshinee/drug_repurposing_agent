Meta Data and Pagination
It is now possible to download all data from a specific ChEMBL web service resource. This is made possible by returning responses from the web services in 'pages', which can be navigated through using a 'page_meta' section. The 'page_meta' section includes information about total number of hits, total number of pages and links to the next and previous pages. An example 'page_meta' section is displayed below:


Copy
"page_meta": {

    "limit": 20,
    "next": "/chembl/api/data/activity.json?limit=20&offset=20",
    "offset": 0,
    "previous": null,
    "total_count": 13520737

}
To download all ChEMBL activity endpoints (>13 million), the following URL can be used: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/api/data/activity. By inspecting the the 'page_meta' section the link to page 2 can be found, e.g. https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/api/data/activity?limit=20&offset=20.

Filtering and Ordering
It is possible to apply search filters to all resource requests using a URL friendly query language. For example, it is possible to return all ChEMBL targets that contain the term 'kinase' in the pref_name attribute with the following URL: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/api/data/target?pref_name__contains=kinase.

The pattern for applying a filter is as follows:


Copy
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/api/data/[resource]?[field]__[filter_type]=[value]
Examples of other filter type are listed in the table below.

Filter Type

Description

Example URL

exact (iexact)

https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/api/data/assay?description__icontains=toxicity

startswith (istartswith)

https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/api/data/target?pref_name__istartswith=serotonin

endswith (iendswith)

https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/api/data/cell_line?cell_source_tissue__iendswith=carcinoma

regex (iregex)

https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/api/data/target/search.json?q=lipoxygenase
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/api/data/chembl_id_lookup/search?q=morphine
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/api/data/activity/search?q=%22TG-GATES%22

only

Select specific properties from the original endpoint and returns only the desired properties on each record

https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/api/data/activity.json?target_chembl_id__in=CHEMBL5552,CHEMBL1075195&pchembl_value__gte=5&assay_type=B&only=molecule_chembl_id,pchembl_value

To order the results returned by a particular field the 'order=[field]' argument as added to a request. For example a user can sort targets based on the pref_name using the following URL: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/api/data/target?order_by=pref_name

The default ordering is in ascending order. To return the results in descending orede place a '-' before the field name: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/api/data/target?order_by=-pref_name

Note that it is possible combine order_by and filter arguments:https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/api/data/target?pref_name__contains=kinase&order_by=-pref_name

Chemical Searching
The 'Substructure' and 'Similarity' web service resources allow for the chemical content of ChEMBL to be searched. Similar to the other resources, these search based resources except filtering, paging and ordering arguments. These methods accept SMILES, InChI Key and molecule ChEMBL_ID as arguments and in the case of similarity searches an additional identity cut-off is needed. Some example molecule searches are provided in the table below.

Chemical Search Description

Example URL

Substructure search for against ChEMBL using aspirin SMILES string

https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/api/data/substructure/CC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)O

Substructure search for against ChEMBL using aspirin CHEMBL_ID

https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/api/data/substructure/CHEMBL25

Substructure search for against ChEMBL using aspirin InChI Key

https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/api/data/substructure/BSYNRYMUTXBXSQ-UHFFFAOYSA-N

Similarity (80% cut off) search for against ChEMBL using aspirin SMILES string

https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/api/data/similarity/CC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)O/80

Similarity (80% cut off) search for against ChEMBL using aspirin CHEMBL_ID

https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/api/data/similarity/CHEMBL25/80

Similarity (80% cut off) search for against ChEMBL using aspirin InChI Key

https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/api/data/similarity/BSYNRYMUTXBXSQ-UHFFFAOYSA-N/80

Searching with InChI key is only possible for InChI keys found in the ChEMBL database. The system does not try and convert InChI key to a chemical representation.
